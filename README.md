# TelephoneDirectorySystem
Complied and ran on visual studio code ubuntu

This is a directory system that takes in input and adds it to tree for quick search capabilities and sorting.
This should be more similar to a database in terms of commands and capabilities.

Currently it is limited to first, last, phone, address.
Other features: adding more like a database and out of order factoring, and updating data to new data.
